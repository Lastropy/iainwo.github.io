Setting clear short-term goals and leveraging them to bound the content I need to study really helped. Last week, I was being overwhelmed by the amount of content you can study; in [that post](https://iainwo.github.io/goals/2019-Week22/) I wrote about my strategy to combat this. The idea was to establish short term goals, my starting point, and what it would take to get from the latter to the former.

I am happy to say - that this week I was firing on all cylinders; and was able to achieve a big portion of my plan - while also, working efficiently enough, to find the time for a few other things!

Here was that plan [from that post](https://iainwo.github.io/goals/2019-Week22/),
![Short-term Goals for ML](https://iainwo.github.io/assets/notes/Goals/Short-Term%20Goals.pdf)

The Goal is to develop the Mathematical Foundation require for ML. The very first node - and a very important node to achieving that is completing [Coursera: Mathematics for ML](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning). There are three parts to this course: linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and principal component analysis. I am working on the first - Linear Algebra. I was very very happy with my productivity this week and was able to finish 3/5 modules in the Linear Algebra section! Having already finished one, I have now completed 4 and will be finishing the last this week.

> This is absolutely HUGE! This Coursera course is one of the three items I set out which will allow me to accomplish my Goal and eventually become a researcher; to have knocked off such a big portion of this item a quickly as I did I am very pleased with. I hope that I will progress with a similar rate throughout the rest of the course.

In case you were wondering, here is what my schedule looked like,
![Week23-Schedule](https://iainwo.github.io/assets/images/goals/2019Week23_calendar.png)

Beyond pumping through those Coursera lessons, I was also able to run a few errands (like picking up some contacts and some sports gear), watch a really cool presentation from Mindbridge on RL, exercise - went to Muay Thai for a change, and hang out with friends - this Sunday :)

However it all wasn't razzle-dazzle, I did miss on a few things:
- not going to bed at 10
- not reading ThinkStats everyday, I'm trying to square away this book little-by-little
- not doing LeetCode, gotta sharpen/keep-sharpened the skillz

In the past I have done similar study regimens and become burnt out; a major goal of mine is to achieve this level of productivity long term while mitigating the negative factors. For me, my anecdotal evidence points to inconsistent and little sleep as having a big impact on my ability to persistently work at the rate that I want. Over the last two weeks my sleep has not been of the quality I want. __This week sleep is my priority.__

Going into next week, I have set these goals:
1. Be in bed, phone away from my bed, by or before 10 PM
2. Ensure to plan the next day's schedule on my Calendar before going to sleep

For content to cover, I have selected these:
1. Finish module #5 of Coursera's Math for ML: Linear Algebra
2. Finish module #1 and #2 of Coursera's Math for ML: Multivariate Calculus
3. Read Least Linear Squares chapter of ThinkStats

Having reviewed my former goals, talked about the ones I have for next week, that ends this blog post. Below find listings of the Meetups I attended, Courses I've progressed through and notes which I've published.

Until next week,
- Iain
