![This week I was learning about Jacobiains and Hessiains har-har ;)](https://iainwo.github.io/assets/images/gradientDescent.png)
The beginning of this week - I was running around with me head cut off. Or at least I felt like it. On August 10th, I leave for Finland and will return to work as an ML researcher; there is 7 weeks between now and then. In that time I will not continue to run around with my head cut off.

Cool, composed and with a deft hand I want to move through these next 7 weeks and execute. I want to hit my weekly goals and ultimately reach my goal of having the necessary mathematical foundation for ML.

You can read up on what comprises "a foundation" [here](https://iainwo.github.io/goals/2019-Week22/).

The assuredness and level-head I'm looking to keep while being absolutely effective can really be represented by this press-conference, from way back in the day, captured by [the dynamic and dualism between Dustin Porier and Conor McGregor](https://youtu.be/9yGpTN74UeE?t=495). The assertive, the comfortability exuded by McGregor and "getting the job done" are really what I'm looking to emulate.

There are 7 weeks, and here is what's on the schedule,
![Short-term Goals for ML](https://iainwo.github.io/assets/notes/Goals/Short-Term%20Goals.pdf)

There are three mid-term goals; for me mid-term is are objectives that take about 1-2 months to complete. Short-term goals are measured in a week or weeks. The three goals I want to accomplish before the end of September are:

1. Coursera - Mathematics for Machine Learning [Jun 4th - Now]
2. Strang's Linear Algebra - MIT OpenCourseWare
3. MIT OpenCourseWare Calculus I.

I started [Coursera's Math for ML course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning?skipBrowseRedirect=true) nearly two weeks ago and now I am 7/15ths complete - near 50 percent complete (it's the forward-looking part of me that is taking the ceiling of .67 to the nearest multiple ten ;). Given that I have 7 weeks; and given my ability to complete nearly half the course in 2 weeks - it seems reasonable that I will be able to complete the Coursera course and carry on with the other items planned.

Those two items: [Strang](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/) and [OCW Calc I.](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/) at first glance comprehensive and [long](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/calendar/). I love that they have so much detail and thoroughness. I am particularly excited for Strang's course because it is lauded as a gold standard and covering nearly everything you need to know about Linear Algebra. At the same time, my heart is pulled towards Calc. I. - I've been told by many that Calculus isn't very important to ML but I really feel like I need a fundamental and rigorous education in it.

Anyways - what I've been getting at saying is that I am progressing to finish Coursera, and the objectives that follow will have to be completed in the remainder of the 7 weeks - it is not my concern at the moment how difficult that task will be once completing Coursera.

At the moment my only concern, is to finish this Coursera Course. I think a fantastic short-term goal would be to finish 1 module during this Mon-Fri, a second this Sat, and a third this Sun. However doing the maths - that means if I were to do this, I will have finished 5/6 modules from the Multivariate Calculus content. This would mean the following week I'd be doing a bit of Calculus as well as continuing on to the last chapter of the Course going over PCA. I don't want to do this. Instead I'm planning big - to crush it, I am going to do (4) Calculus modules this week. Scheduling myself to complete two of those modules during the week, and then one per each day of the weekend 🤪.

This is going to be monumental; but I can accomplish it. I will rely heavily on maintaining a schedule, having the discipline and focus to stick to that schedule and trying to maintain my calm.

I do have several events coming up next week which will require some of my time but I believe I can work around them:

1. Public Lecture: What is missing from common practice in ML
2. ML Workshop: Learning in the presence of class bias
3. Ottawa Footy-Sevens Soccer Game
4. Get soccer cleats
5. Maybe go for a run with a friend

### Review of Last Weeks Goals
Last week I had several goals - related to both study and life, they were these:

Life goals:
1. Be in bed, phone away from my bed, by or before 10 PM
2. Ensure to plan the next day's schedule on my Calendar before going to sleep

Study goals:
1. Finish module #5 of Coursera's Math for ML: Linear Algebra
2. Finish module #1 and #2 of Coursera's Math for ML: Multivariate Calculus
3. Read Least Linear Squares chapter of ThinkStats

I am very happy to say I succeeded with my Study Goals #1 and #2 - they out of all of last weeks Goals were the most important. I also accomplished my Life Goal #1 - get to bed by 10 PM (except for one day - where my disciplined slipped and I spent too much time trying to figure out this algorithm question).

I failed when it came to 1) making sure to have my schedule planned and 2) reading the Least Linear Squares chapter of ThinkStats. The second goal early into the week I realized I wasn't going to hit and quickly dropped that goal. I came to the conclusion that it was a "nice-to-have" but not a prerequisite - also it didn't factor into the mid-term goals I laid out above.

The 1) not planning out my schedule the night before was a critical failure - I should have had that done. Maybe 2 or 3 days of the week I forgot to do it the night before. To be honest I was so wiped that I once I finished grinding through whatever I had at the end of the day - I quickly took care of hygiene related things: teeth, shower, laundry and then fell straight to sleep.

I like planning my schedule at the end of the day because it is most apparent to me what I need to work on during the following day - but also it helps me set my mind for what I need to do the following day. It's as much practical as it is a mental exercise pour moi. I think going into the week I am going to continue to keep that activity around the time I go to bed and make sure to remind myself - via calendar, or by doing it half-hour earlier in that night so I don't just skip past it.

Going into next week my life goals are:
1. Get to sleep by 9:30 PM
2. Plan calendar night before

I found that I functioned better with more sleep (i.e getting to bed at 10 PM.) this week I want to try to get to bed earlier - starting at 9:30 PM.

Here is what my schedule looked like this week. It was a huge success of mine to grind through the 2nd Calc Module this Sunday and still make it in time to hangout with my friend. I was literally scribbling all day from near the moment I got up till 4 PM - even when writing this my hand is kinda sore!

That's it for Week 24!!!
See you next,
- Iain
