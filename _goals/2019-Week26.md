Goals are sacrosanct. They are the utensils by which you eat your food - they are the spades needed to build your garden - they are the hammers required build your house. It is an imperative that you honour your Goals as a tool, and maintain them - else their rot and rust leave you useless.

Condemned - are you, if you abandon your tools by the wayside; for such activity will surely become a habit.

In [Lessons in Failure](https://iainwo.github.io/goals/2019-Week25/) a section from my last post, I described two significant impediments to reaching my weekly goals:

1. "Big Wins" - overarching stability is more important than risky big-wins. I need to lean towards more consistent and robust processes that keep "me" in a favourable state-of-mind to go about accomplishing my goals
    1.1. Energy Levels - via sleep, excersize
    1.2. Physical Health - via exersize
    1.3. Mental Health - sleep, creativity, motivation, enthusiasm/fun
2. Disruptions in Productivity - when I am in that state of stability I need to capitalize and not lose time to hiccups in productivity or inefficiency due to micro-level disruptances; like several convoluted lines of text (as opposed to the macro-level inhibitions such as fundamental pain points in my general philosophy/approach to learning) or not understanding a certain geometric or mathematical intuition.

This week, I stuck to those ideas and accomplished the short term goals I had set out for myself:

✅ Continue to get to sleep by 9:30 PM, maybe 9:00 PM
✅ Plan calendar night before
✅ Finish the Coursera: Calculus course by Sunday

I've chosen to outline these accomplishments first because they were **goals** and I was serious about them - when I said I was going to do them. The most important part is that - **I did accomplish them**. For the very reasons introduced in the beginning this post (i.e that is integral that you honour your goals), I consider this a win; but more than just any win - a vital win.

In the my last post where I set these goals, I hinted that these three goals were much, much more conservative then my previous accomplishments. Positively, did I low-ball my goals. But the more I think about it I reject that sentiment. In reflection I've thought about my two significant impediments "big wins" and "disrupted productivity"; and that I suffered neither this week when I went about accomplishing the three goals I had. I think that is really something to ponder and value. The salient idea - is that I accomplished my "goals" and I did it without any of the friction that has been significantly impacting me 🙌.

##### The Realities and a Method for Madness
However the reality is, that last week I was relatively unproductive. To evaluate my progress towards my longer-term goals singularly in the way I did above is not tenable.

In ten years from now, I would be no-where. That is really, really, horrifyingly, panicingly scary. The consequences of - being where I am today - tomorrow, would be insurmountable and irrecoverable.

Therefor I must adhere to the tenets described previously: overarching stability, minimizing disruptions to productivity and honouring your goals, whilst maintain a high rate of productivity.

A while ago, by happenstance, I was watching a tech video by Joma [Guy with a 2.9 GPA makes $300K as SWE](https://youtu.be/YGflHj1SjA4) - despite the tasteless title, Joma was a great resource for me to learn more about the Silicon Valley culture, navigating the job market and tidbits about FANG companies. Joma's guest goes on to mention and describe, a framework he came by for maintaining motivation - which the guest used to prep for interviewing as an Software Engineer (SWE). I'm not sure if this was the article he was the original article he was referencing but it contains similar if not the same content [here](https://mindfulambition.net/motivation-equation/).

In the [motivation equation](https://mindfulambition.net/motivation-equation/), there is a basic formula expressing motivation and it's related variables - to be honest I don't think they relationships between those variables are accurate nor their asymptotic relationships but as a back-of-the-napkin approximation it definitely outlines significant involved variables and their cooperative or opposing relationships. The equation is as below:

```
motivation = (expectancy * value)/ (impulsivity * delay)

where,
motivation - is how energized you feel to do something
expectancy - how likely you think it is that you will receive the payoff from taking action
value - how highly you value the payoff of taking the action
impulsivity - how distractible you are while taking action
delay - how far away the deadline is
```

I reckon that my productivity dropped last week because I found out that I would be changing to the ML team early (this Tuesday). I was really pumped at the idea of being super prepared and having a sure mathematical footing in advance before joining that team - and was put off by the adjusted timeline (although overall I am still super excited to begin doing ML! 😍). There was no way I could learn all that mathematical content I had planned over the next two months - in just several days. Using the motivation model above - a lot of the value which was driving my motivation was founded on the idea of being prepared.

Having the underpinnings of my motivation towards a large mid-term goal hoisted out from under me was disconcerting and it made me question the meta - "how and if it is even possible to insure the motivation needed to accomplish mid/long-term goals that that are fraught with the risk of losing large time and resource investments". The thing that came to mind was that motivation model above and structuring my "expectancy" and "value" in a robust and diversified way such that I can reorient or isolate the degree to which factors out of my control can undermine my motivation.

For example, realizing that the ultimate goal for me is be able to acquire the necessary mathematical foundation for Research in ML in an Academic or Industry setting. Then deconstructing that idea into parts: I want to be prepped when joining the ML team, I want to do research, I like math and want to get good at math for transferable opportunities in the future. Thereby being able to express multivariately a host of "expectancies" and their respective "values". This going forward will be my method for [when there is] madness (things happening out of my control).

##### A Review of the Mid-term Goals
Given that I'm doing ML a lot earlier than expected - more immediate than ever I need to have a good grip on Statistical Methods. I really feel like I need to read Elements of Statistical Learning.

I also recognize that doing [FastAI's Numerical Linear Algebra](https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra/blob/master/README.md) is probably more relevant than doing an OCW Calculus or Linear Algebra course.

I also recognize that I need to study up on:

1. Probability
2. Statistics
3. Discrete Maths
4. Some calculus and linear algebra techniques

However I have this gut feeling that I can't shake that I need to get a relatable well-worn academic base of Calculus and Linear Algebra. On that grounds I am going to stick to the original path that I described for my midterm goals.

![Original Plan](https://iainwo.github.io/assets/notes/Goals/Short-Term%20Goals.pdf)

For next week I have these tech goals:

1. Finish module #1 for Coursera's Mathematics for ML: PCA.
2. Finish module #2 for Coursera's Mathematics for ML: PCA.

For life goals I have:

1. Get to sleep by 9:00 PM - need more sleep I think!!

I have previously written about my mid-term goals. You can find them [here](https://iainwo.github.io/goals/2019-Week22/).
