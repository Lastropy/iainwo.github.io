I am very happy to announce that I have written my first paper - well sort of. It presents several forms of visualization for the Deformed Covariance Formula.
> This was a really, really exciting journey for me. It was a really weird equation that was hard for me to prove without consulting the original mathematical publication. I became familiar with a neat trick used to do the proof - as well as produce an equation of my own.

The paper is not published - I know. This is more my attempt to iterate - and get practice in before I publish research papers for real.

You can find that paper here on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1skP9czJOHIp-1Qp_y4q7EbFSW5HbelTF?pli=1#scrollTo=3WNoq7bSb4r2).

This was all borne out of confusion for the following formula,

Cov[X, Y] = 1/2 * 1/n^2 sum[i->n] sum[j->n] (xi -xj)(yi - yj)

This formula can be found in this research paper [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yuli_Zhang/publication/261496020_Some_new_deformation_formulas_about_variance_and_covariance/links/54eda4c80cf25da9f7f1274e.pdf) by Yuli Zhang, Huaiyu Wu, and Lei Cheng.

This comprised the bulk of my work this week.

Next week my goals are to be productive taking on the last modules of PCA in the Coursera: Math for ML course and taking on ML Part 1 of FastAI's course at work.
